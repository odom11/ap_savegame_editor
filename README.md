# ap_savegame_editor

this is a savegame editor for alpha protocol. It allows changing the following aspects of a savegame
* money
* number of free stat points
* gadgets (EMP grenades etc)
* ammunition

The same could be achieved loading the file into a hex editor, but I found this more convenient.

The software was created with Visual Studio 2019 using Qt5. It can be freely distributed or modified.
